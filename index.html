  <h1>Process</h1>  
    <p class="desc">Cordova Web started with a simple idea of building a relationship with our local market in hopes to request more organic vegetables. With both our history in food organizing, we wanted to go about this in a thoughtful, conscious way. This led to much deeper discussions on how to be involved in one's community, what the role of the individual is, and what our role was, and what the role of a neighborhood plays in a city that has been quickly gentrified, and continues to change throughout the pandemic. We wanted to create a lasting relationship that benefited both the health of the community, and the health of Cordova Market.

    We started by meeting online, mostly due to the pandemic, but also because we wanted to start with researching basic facts about our neighborhood. This was interesting, but ultimately we decided the best way to get involved in the neighborhood was to physically go outside. We met outside Cordova market, to observe the surroundings and sketch. This led to many warm, welcoming, and engaging conversations with our neighbors. This was also a way to introduce ourselves to the store’s employees and management. We hoped to interview the employees and hear more about their experiences during the pandemic, and how Cordova has impacted the neighborhood. This also still being the height of the pandemic, it was a fun way to spend time outside, and got us reminiscing about being kids and for a time when someone could just go outside to connect with neighbors. This also led to thoughts about what a post Covid world could look like, what a more equitable food system, neighborhood, and city would look like. 

    About a month into our project, Rossie’s class introduced an assignment that involved a direct action that required engaging with one’s community on Election Day, November, 3rd 2020. Having recently been inspired by our time outside, we started thinking how to connect this assignment to our project, and started to reimagine a project that focused not just on food, but how we are connected to each other through food, community, and proximity to space. Were inspired by … Mister Rogers, Food Empowerment Project, Guy Debord. We decided the best way to convey this was though the Cordova Web mapping ritual/project.  
    
    We started by printing a large map of the neighborhood, with the idea to have participants leave their “mark” on the map and connect to one another through glow in the dark yarn. After troubleshooting a couple different materials from SCRAP, we ended up with a solid board from Building Resources, which we painted black to provide a nice contrast to our large printed map. We played around with different lighting too, but found a small blacklight flashlight seemed to do the trick. Election Day came, and we spent the evening chatting with our neighbors about what role Cordova has played for them during the pandemic. With a backdrop of boarded up windows, we found that an art project that centered human interaction was very welcome, and got to know our neighbors and our local food system even better.
