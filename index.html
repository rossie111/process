  <h1>Process</h1>  
    <div class="desc">Cordova Web started with a simple idea of building a relationship with our local market in hopes to request more organic vegetables. With both our history in food organizing, we wanted to go about this in a thoughtful, conscious way. This led to much deeper discussions on how to be involved in one's community, what the role of the individual is, and what our role was, and what the role of a neighborhood plays in a city that has been quickly gentrified, and continues to change throughout the pandemic. We wanted to create a lasting relationship that benefited both the health of the community, and the health of Cordova Market.<p>

    We started by meeting online, mostly due to the pandemic, but also because we wanted to start with researching basic facts about our neighborhood. This was interesting, but ultimately we decided the best way to get involved in the neighborhood was to physically go outside. We met outside Cordova market, to observe the surroundings and sketch. <p>

    Quick sketching is a method typically applied to figure drawing that allows an artist to familiarize themselves with the object of their focus.  This is done in 1, 2, 5, and 10 minute intervals, respectively.  Each second is an opportunity of intimacy that forces an artist to really focus on the most key elements of an object, and in this particular case: a market.  <p>

    Below are the sketches from this exercise. 


    <!--This led to many warm, welcoming, and engaging conversations with our neighbors. This was also a way to introduce ourselves to the store’s employees and management. We hoped to interview the employees and hear more about their experiences during the pandemic, and how Cordova has impacted the neighborhood. This also still being the height of the pandemic, it was a fun way to spend time outside, and got us reminiscing about being kids and for a time when someone could just go outside to connect with neighbors. This also led to thoughts about what a post Covid world could look like, what a more equitable food system, neighborhood, and city would look like.--> <p>
